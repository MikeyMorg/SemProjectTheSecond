## Abstract
    This notebook will be used to analyze data, so we can make predictions on if someone has a sleep disorder or not.
    The data that we will be analyzing contains different lifestyle, physiolgical and demographic factors
    that we will use as our training metrics to be able to predict if there is a sleeping disorder present.
    This data comes from a Kaggle Competition, https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/sleep-disorder-prediction-challenge.

## Data
    The training data given to us is within a sub-folder labeled 'data', under train_data.csv.
    Our testing data is within the same subfolder, labeled under test_data_competition.csv.

## Requirements
    Attached in this folder is a requirements.txt file that can be used to check the requirements needed
    for your environment when wanting to run this code.

## SemProject
    This subfolder was created when we made our virtual environment.

## src Folder
    The sub-folder, src, will have our jupyter notebook, titled 'SemProj.ipynb'
    where we unpacked the data, analyzed it and started our prediction process.
